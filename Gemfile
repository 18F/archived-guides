# We are pinning to this version of jekyll because of problems with the
# search plugin that is required as part of guides_style_18f.
# For background, see https://github.com/18F/guides-style/issues/84 and
# https://github.com/18F/jekyll_pages_api_search/issues/37
# This is especially unfortunate because we don't even use the search
# functionality as part of this guide.
