<h1>18F Guides</h1>

<p>18F Guides is the repository for best practices across our teams. 
Our guides are open source, and you're free to use them as you wish.
Our hope is that other digital service teams — both inside and outside the government — 
will adopt or modify the practices outlined here. </p> 

<p>By developing this material in the open, 
we hope to encourage expert review and contributions from members of the tech community, 
furthering our goal of improving how government works through increased civic engagement of tech specialists.</p> 

<p>To create a new 18F Guide, or to update an existing guide to the 18F Guide format, 
see the <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/guides-template/">18F Guides template</a>.</p>
