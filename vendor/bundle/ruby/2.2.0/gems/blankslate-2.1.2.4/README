BlankSlate
===

BlankSlate provides an abstract base class with no predefined
methods (except for <tt>\_\_send__</tt> and <tt>\_\_id__</tt>).
BlankSlate is useful as a base class when writing classes that
depend upon <tt>method_missing</tt> (e.g. dynamic proxies).

Extracted from Builder because, for no conceivable reason,
blankslate isn't in its own gem. Gemified by David Masover,
moved to gemcutter by Jack Danger Canty (gemcutter@6brand.com
if you'd like to own this gem).

Explanation on extraction from David Masover:

So, Builder seems to have the most complete implementation of
BlankSlate, short of Ruby 1.9's BasicObject. The problem is,
this is part of Builder, and still inside the Builder gem.

It's especially frustrating, because the Builder source
(lib/builder/blankslate.rb) seems to acknowledge that there
should be a separate gem. But the only reference I can find
refers to onestepback.org's gem repository, which isn't working.

So I built my own. I'll try to keep it up to date with Builder.
The first three parts of the version number are
the Builder version; the last part is my revision.
