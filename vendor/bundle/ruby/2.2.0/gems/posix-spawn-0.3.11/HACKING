Clone the project:

   git clone http://github.com/rtomayko/posix-spawn.git
   cd posix-spawn
   bundle install

Rake tasks can be run without further setup:

   rake build
   rake test
   rake benchmark

Just `rake' builds the extension and runs the tests.

If you want to run the benchmark scripts or tests directly out of a
working copy, first setup your PATH and RUBYLIB environment:

    PATH="$(pwd)/bin:$PATH"
    RUBYLIB="$(pwd)/lib:$(pwd)/ext:$RUBYLIB"
    export RUBYLIB

Or, use the following rbdev script to quickly setup your PATH and
RUBYLIB environment for this and other projects adhering to the
Ruby Packaging Standard:
